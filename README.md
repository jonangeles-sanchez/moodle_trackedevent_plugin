# Event Check-In
## Description
The basic premise of this part of the project is that this will allow attendees to check-in
to an event using a QR code-based system. Essentially:
1. An admin will create an event
2. They will display an unique QR code to an attendee
3. Attendee will scan the unique QR code and login to verify their identity
4. That QR code is no longer valid for anyone else, and will return an error if used again
5. Admin chooses to show a new unique QR code for next attendee
